# CampFire

CampFire is a social network application built for OpenBuild LACUNA. 

## What Is It?
It utilizes iBeacon technology in order to connect people in similar proximities. Each *Room*, designated by an iBeacon, has it's own social network page to post statuses and see who else is in the room. You can then check out the other users in the room and see what they're working on, and go interact and meet them. It's a great way to see what's going on in rooms around you and connect to people you normally wouldn't.
